what is node
---------------------
runtime environment for javascript


how js gets executed in browser
------------------------------------
v8 engine


node => chrome's js v8 engine + apis and modules



how to install nodejs
----------------------------------




global variables
-----------------------------------
variables which store some data and can be accessed from anywhere in your code - no matter hw deeply nested your code is.

commonly used global variables:
    1. __dirname: stores the path to the current working directory
    2. __filename: stores the path to the current working file


    global.myVariable = "hello world";



modules in nodejs
--------------------------------------
a module is a collection of reusable code

1. user modules
    module.exports
    require()

2. built-in modules
    these are the modules included in node by default. so we can use them without installation.

        OS
         provides the operating system information

         upTime
         userInfo
         type
         release
         totalmem
         freemem

        PATH
            to work with file and directory paths

            - join path segments together
            - tell if a path is absolute or not
            - get last portion/segment of a path
            - get file extension from a path
            - AND MUCH MORE!

            basename
            extname
            dirname
            parse
            sep
            join
            resolve

        FS
            to work with files (for file handling)

            - read files (both synchronous and asynchronous)
            - write files (both synchronous and asynchronous)
            - delete files
            - read contents of a directory
            - renaming a file
            - creating a directory
            - AND MUCH MORE!

            mkdir
            writeFile
            appendFile
            readFile
            readdir
            rename
            unlink


        HTTP
            provides functionality to create HTTP servers and make http requests.

            createServer
                res.writeHead
                res.end


3. external modules
    these modules are created by other developers which are not included by default. we need to install them first before using them.

    npm i <module_name>

    npm - nahi pata mujhe
